## üö¶ Limits and best practices

The API doesn't impose a strict limit on requests per minute, but implements automatic protection mechanisms against abusive use.

To ensure stability and performance, we recommend the following practices:

- Avoid unnecessary simultaneous multiple requests.

- Maintain an average volume of up to **60 requests per minute per environment**.

- Always implement retry control with exponential backoff in continuous integrations.

::: tip Tip
Implement cache for data that doesn't change frequently and monitor your integration usage.

## üí∞ Billing

Currently, the API is completely free.
If this changes in the future, you will be informed in advance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è HTTP methods used

The API follows standard HTTP methods to indicate the desired operation type:

<script setup>

const methodsTable = [
  { key: 'GET', description: 'Query data', color: 'blue' },
  { key: 'POST', description: 'Create new data or execute actions', color: 'green' },
  { key: 'PUT', description: 'Update existing data completely', color: 'purple' },
  { key: 'PATCH', description: 'Update existing data partially', color: 'yellow' },
  { key: 'DELETE', description: 'Delete existing data', color: 'red' }
]
</script>
