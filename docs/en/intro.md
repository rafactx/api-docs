## ðŸš€ Introduction

The **Involves Stage** API allows you to easily integrate external systems, automating processes and simplifying your operations.
Developed following REST principles, our API is intuitive, easy to use, and fully compatible with common HTTP clients, with no need for special development.

---

The base URL for all requests is:

::: code-group

```bash [Base URL]
https://exemplo.involves.com/webservices/api/v3
```

```javascript [Basic example]
const baseUrl = 'https://exemplo.involves.com/webservices/api/v3';
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('usuario:senha'),
  'X-AGILE-CLIENT': 'EXTERNAL_APP',
  'Accept-Version': '2020-02-26'
};

fetch(baseUrl, { headers })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

```python [Basic example]
import requests

base_url = 'https://exemplo.involves.com/webservices/api/v3'
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + base64.b64encode('usuario:senha'.encode()).decode(),
    'X-AGILE-CLIENT': 'EXTERNAL_APP',
    'Accept-Version': '2020-02-26'
}

response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

::: tip Tip
Never test directly in the production environment.

Create a specific environment (sandbox) with exclusive users for testing.

If you need help setting up, [open a ticket with Support](https://help.involves.com/hc/pt-br/requests/new){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
